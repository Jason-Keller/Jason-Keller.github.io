	<h2>The Day The Earth Started Moving Again</h2>

	<p class="quote">Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.</p>

	<p>
	Let your imagination be your guide. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. This piece of canvas is your world. Just use the old one inch brush. A beautiful little sunset. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Happy painting, God bless. Son of a gun. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>

	<p>
	Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use:</p>
