        <h1>On Our Way To The Hospital*</h1>
        <p>On our way to the hospital again</p>
        <p>As you lean your head out my window and vomit</p>
        <p>Carried you out the back</p>
        <p>Safe haven in my arms</p>
        <p>A dead-end friendship under burning electric stars</p>
        <p>"You were so sweet"</p>
        <p>You muttered in the unbroken din</p>
        <p>And</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I swore it wouldn't happen again."</p>
        <p><strong>[Bridge]</strong></p>
        <p>Oh brilliant theater of light</p>
        <p>Oh great darkness closing in</p>
        <p>Don't you know how it hurts when you say:</p>
        <p>"I never agreed to this type of livin'"</p>
        <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
        <p>On our way to the hospital again</p>
        <p>Bright and early dawn of Sunday morning</p>
        <p>You came back home</p>
        <p>You cast the first stone</p>
        <p>On our way to the hospital again</p>
        <p>You'll swear that this time you almost got them</p>
