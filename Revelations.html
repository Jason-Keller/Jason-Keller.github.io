You squeeze your mouth shut, trying to keep as much of the dirtied water and grit from your lungs as you can. You still can&#39;t help but let a scream a echo in your starved lungs.

Your brother is in the driver seat, eyes shut, his crop of blond hair tugged upwards as the car dives lower and lower. A cloud of blood - his own blood - chases him downward into the river. Funny, it looks a little bit like cigaratte smoke, the way it whispers up into the air. He hated how you smoked and said it&#39;d kill you.

Now you&#39;re fighting against your seatbelt, desperate for air and desperate for your brother to wake up. Panic rising in your heart, a fist unseen pounds against your ribcage - you can hear the panicked beat of your heart in your ears like war tribal drums, deafening, fast, getting faster - your vision clouds with little black stars as your fingers press down on the seatbelt release.

His limp body drifts free.

His eyes remain shut, peaceful, like he was just taking a nap.

You scream at him to wake up, but the river swallows your voice, and all the adrenaline in the world can&#39;t replenish the air in your lungs or give you more time. 

There is no more time.
You shove your body out the passenger side window and grasp at open water, pining for the surface, counting seconds as if they were your last. How long can you hold your breath? 

You look down, back at your brother&#39;s car - it fades away from you, like an object passing deeper into space.

1 seconds
2 seconds
3 seconds
4 seconds

And air.

They made you nervous. Eyes like a coyote&#39;s, patient with their clipboards and their notes. You don&#39;t know if it&#39;s your own paranoia and predjudices or if they&#39;re all conspiring against you. Coyote&#39;s work together and hunt in packs, right? Or was that wolves? Maybe they both-

&quot;How was your weekend, Michael?&quot; She asks. Your eyes flick towards her bookshelf when her pale blue eyes meet yours. She&#39;s smiling, please to be here, pleased to have you in her office. 

Her office is cramped with books and oddities acquired during her trips to Jureselam, Rome, China, and a few places you couldn&#39;t point to on a map.

&quot;I&#39;m alright,&quot; you finally manage with a sigh. &quot;Applied to a Walgreens yesterday.&quot;

Doctor Stowell nods, her pleased smile stretching across her face. &quot;That&#39;s really great to hear. I think that was one of our goals for this month.&quot;

She smiles warmly at you, her legs crossed as she leans forward in her chair. She doesn&#39;t use a notepad like the others. You feel like you can trust her among all the others.
